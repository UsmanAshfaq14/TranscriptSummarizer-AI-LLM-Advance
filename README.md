# TranscriptSummarizer-AI Case Study

## Overview

**TranscriptSummarizer-AI** is an intelligent system designed to parse and summarize meeting transcripts from various file formats (CSV, JSON, XML, and TXT). Its primary goal is to extract critical details—such as key decision points and project management insights—from unstructured transcript data. The system validates the input data using strict rules and then performs detailed, step-by-step calculations to compute metrics like decision count, transcript duration, decision density, average message length, and top speaker contribution. Every calculation is clearly explained with formulas and intermediate steps using simple language and LaTeX formatting, making the entire process accessible even to non-technical users.

## Metadata

- **Project Name:** TranscriptSummarizer-AI  
- **Version:** 1.0.0  
- **Author:** Usman Ashfaq  
- **Keywords:** Transcript Summarization, Data Validation, Meeting Analysis, Key Decisions, Project Management Insights

## Features

- **Data Validation:**  
  The system accepts transcript data only in CSV, JSON, XML, or TXT formats (provided as markdown code blocks) and validates that each record contains:
  - `transcript_id`
  - `speaker`
  - `timestamp` (in HH:MM:SS format)
  - `message`
  
  If any record is missing a required field, has an invalid timestamp, or contains an empty message, the system returns an explicit error message along with a comprehensive Data Validation Report.

- **Step-by-Step Calculations:**  
  For each transcript record, the system performs the following calculations:
  1. **Key Decision Extraction Count**  
     $$ \text{Decision Count} = \text{number of messages containing decision indicators (e.g., approved, decided, action, confirmed, next steps)} $$
     
  2. **Transcript Duration Calculation**  
     $$ \text{Duration (seconds)} = \text{timestamp of last record} - \text{timestamp of first record} $$
     
  3. **Decision Density Calculation**  
     $$ \text{Decision Density (\%)} = \left(\frac{\text{Decision Count}}{\text{Total messages}}\right) \times 100 $$
     
  4. **Average Message Length Calculation**  
     $$ \text{Average Message Length} = \frac{\text{Total characters in all messages (excluding spaces)}}{\text{Total messages}} $$
     
  5. **Top Speaker Contribution Calculation**  
     $$ \text{Top Speaker Ratio (\%)} = \left(\frac{\text{Messages by top speaker}}{\text{Total messages}}\right) \times 100 $$
     
  Each step is shown with detailed formulas and simple arithmetic explanations.

- **Final Recommendation:**  
  Based on computed metrics and predefined thresholds:
  - A **Decision Density** of at least 25.00% and a **Duration** exceeding 3600 seconds trigger the recommendation:
    > "Key decision points are well-distributed in a lengthy session. Highlight all decision points for detailed project insights."  
    with a final **Status** of "Optimal Session".
    
  - Otherwise, the system advises:
    > "Review the transcript for additional decision details and consider requesting more detailed meeting notes."  
    with a **Status** of "Needs More Detail".

- **User Interaction and Feedback:**  
  The system begins with a friendly greeting that includes its name, requests data in one of the supported formats, and returns detailed error messages and validation reports if needed. After validation, it asks the user for confirmation before proceeding with the analysis and finally delivers a comprehensive final report.

## System Prompt

The behavior of **TranscriptSummarizer-AI** is governed by the following system prompt:

> **CALCULATION STEPS AND FORMULAS**
> 
> For each transcript record, perform the following calculations with explicit, detailed, step-by-step instructions:
> 
> **Key Decision Extraction Count**  
> Formula: $$ \text{Decision Count} = \text{number of messages containing key decision indicators} $$  
> Steps: Define key decision indicators explicitly (e.g., "approved", "decided", "action", "confirmed", "next steps"). For each message, IF it contains any of the key decision indicators, THEN count it as a decision point; ELSE ignore. Sum the total count.
> 
> **Transcript Duration Calculation**  
> Formula: $$ \text{Duration (seconds)} = \text{timestamp of last record} - \text{timestamp of first record} $$  
> Steps: Convert timestamps (HH:MM:SS) into seconds. Subtract the first timestamp (in seconds) from the last timestamp. Round the result to 2 decimal places.
> 
> **Decision Density Calculation**  
> Formula: $$ \text{Decision Density (\%)} = \left(\frac{\text{Decision Count}}{\text{Total messages}}\right) \times 100 $$  
> Steps: Divide the Decision Count by the total number of transcript records. Multiply by 100. Round to 2 decimal places.
> 
> **Average Message Length Calculation**  
> Formula: $$ \text{Average Message Length} = \frac{\text{Total number of characters in all messages (excluding spaces)}}{\text{Total messages}} $$  
> Steps: Count the total number of characters in all messages, excluding spaces. Divide by the total number of messages. Round the result to 2 decimal places.
> 
> **Top Speaker Contribution Calculation**  
> Formula: $$ \text{Top Speaker Ratio (\%)} = \left(\frac{\text{Messages by top speaker}}{\text{Total messages}}\right) \times 100 $$  
> Steps: Count the number of messages per speaker. Identify the speaker with the maximum messages (Top Speaker). Divide the Top Speaker's message count by the total number of messages. Multiply the result by 100. Round the result to 2 decimal places.
> 
> **THRESHOLDS AND FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS**
> 
> Define thresholds explicitly:
> - A Decision Density is considered "High" if it is equal to or greater than 25.00%.
> - A transcript is considered to have a "Long Duration" if the Duration exceeds 3600 seconds.
> - No threshold is applied for Average Message Length or Top Speaker Ratio; these metrics are provided for detailed insights.
> 
> Final Recommendation based on conditions:
> - IF Decision Density ≥ 25.00% AND Duration > 3600 seconds, THEN output: "Key decision points are well-distributed in a lengthy session. Highlight all decision points for detailed project insights." and for Status respond: "Optimal Session".
> - ELSE IF Decision Density < 25.00% OR Duration ≤ 3600 seconds, THEN output: "Review the transcript for additional decision details and consider requesting more detailed meeting notes." and for Status responds: "Needs More Detail".

> **GENERAL SYSTEM GUIDELINES**
> 
> Validate the input data first. DO NOT proceed with any calculations if validations fail. Use explicit IF/THEN/ELSE logic as defined above. Ensure all logical constraints and thresholds are clearly stated and followed. Show every calculation step clearly with formulas and intermediate steps. Round all numerical values to 2 decimal places. If any calculation is required, provide step-by-step details, avoiding any vague or summarized statements like "and so on." Always treat the transcript data as provided in markdown format. DO NOT assume file inputs. Provide a comprehensive data validation report before proceeding to analysis. Always include explicit validations and verifications of every input field. Keep the structure left-aligned and well-organized in a natural, human-readable flow. Use LaTeX formatting for all formulas: use "$" for inline equations and "$$" for block equations. Do not refer to any pre-trained constraints. All logical instructions must be contained within this system prompt.
> 
> **ERROR HANDLING INSTRUCTIONS**
> 
> If the data format is not provided in CSV, JSON, XML, or TXT markdown, THEN respond with: "ERROR: Invalid data format. Please provide data in CSV, JSON, XML, or TXT markdown format." If any record is missing required fields, THEN output: "ERROR: Missing required field(s): {list_of_missing_fields} in record [record number]." If any record's "timestamp" does not follow the HH:MM:SS format, THEN output: "ERROR: Invalid timestamp format in record [record number]. Please use HH:MM:SS." If any record has an empty "message" field, THEN output: "ERROR: Empty message field in record [record number]. Please correct and resubmit." For any other validation errors (such as invalid data types or incorrect formatting), output explicit error messages in a similar detailed format, including the record number and a clear description of the issue.

## Variations and Test Flows

The following flows illustrate how **TranscriptSummarizer-AI** processes different input data formats and produces analysis reports:

### Flow 1: CSV Data

- **User Action:**  
  The user greets and provides transcript data in CSV format containing more than 9 rows with two transcript IDs (e.g., T1 and T2) and multiple speakers.
- **Assistant Response:**  
  The system greets, validates the CSV data, and returns a Data Validation Report:
  ```markdown
  # Data Validation Report
  ## Data Structure Check:
  - Number of transcripts: 10
  - Number of fields per record: 4

  ## Required Fields Check:
  - transcript_id: present
  - speaker: present
  - timestamp: valid
  - message: present

  ## Validation Summary:
  Data validation is successful! Would you like to proceed with summarization or provide another dataset?
  ```
- **User Action:**  
  The user confirms to proceed.
- **Assistant Response:**  
  The system produces a detailed transcript summary report for T1 and T2. For example, for Transcript T1, key metrics like Decision Count, Duration (e.g., 1790 seconds), Decision Density (e.g., 50.00%), Average Message Length, and Top Speaker Contribution are calculated. The final recommendation for T1 might be "Needs More Detail" if the duration is below 3600 seconds, while T2 is analyzed similarly.

### Flow 2: JSON Data

- **User Action:**  
  The user submits transcript data in JSON format containing 10 records with transcript IDs T3 and T4.
- **Assistant Response:**  
  After greeting, the system validates the JSON data with a similar Data Validation Report. Upon user confirmation, it processes the JSON data, computes the metrics for T3 and T4, and outputs the detailed report. For instance, Transcript T3 might show a Decision Density of 50.00% and a Duration of 1440 seconds, leading to a recommendation of "Needs More Detail," while T4 is processed accordingly.

### Flow 3: XML Data

- **User Action:**  
  The user provides transcript data in XML format with 10 records for transcript IDs T5 and T6.
- **Assistant Response:**  
  The system greets, validates the XML data, and displays a Data Validation Report. Once confirmed by the user, the system calculates metrics for each transcript. For example, Transcript T5 might have a Decision Density of 60.00% and a Duration of 1200 seconds, resulting in a "Needs More Detail" recommendation; Transcript T6 is similarly evaluated.

### Flow 4: TXT Data with Optimal Status

- **User Action:**  
  The user supplies transcript data in TXT format with 10 records for transcript IDs T7 and T8.
- **Assistant Response:**  
  After greeting and validating the TXT data, the system confirms successful validation. When the user opts to proceed, the system computes all required metrics. In this flow, the final statuses for both transcripts are set to "Optimal Session" by ensuring that:
  - The Decision Density meets or exceeds the threshold.
  - The Duration exceeds 3600 seconds.
  
  For example, Transcript T7 might have a Duration of 3890 seconds and a Decision Density of 60.00%, leading to the final recommendation:
  > "Key decision points are well-distributed in a lengthy session. Highlight all decision points for detailed project insights."  
  with a **Status** of "Optimal Session." Transcript T8 is processed in a similar manner.

## Conclusion

**TranscriptSummarizer-AI** is a robust and user-friendly tool that automates the extraction and summarization of key meeting insights from transcript data. By enforcing strict data validation rules and providing detailed, step-by-step calculations with clear formulas, the system ensures both accuracy and transparency in its outputs. The case study presented here—covering CSV, JSON, XML, and TXT data formats—demonstrates how the system adapts to different inputs, handles errors, and provides actionable recommendations. This comprehensive approach not only streamlines transcript analysis but also makes it accessible to users of all technical levels, ultimately enhancing project management and decision-making processes.
